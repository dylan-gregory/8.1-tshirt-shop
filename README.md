## 8.1 - T-shirt Shop

Our fancy t-shirt shop project was the first official time that we put cookies and localstorage to use. Being the precursor to official user authentication for us, we used both localstorage and cookies to log a customer in, persist a shopping cart of cool shirts, and place a mock order.
